A Full Stack Online Multiplayer Sudoku Game.

This project is build with Python - Flask and Javascript.

Official Beta!
The game is now playable. The interface works well on mobile,
multiplayer is implemented, and the UI is useable.

TODO for the future:
  - Make the database more permanent
  - Improve the room UI
  - Add timestamps/speedrun stuff
  - Polish the UI
  - Make the game compatible with more screen sizes and devices
  - Probably much more
